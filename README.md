# About No_Idea
No_Idea is supposed to be a game about things.
I haven't achieved any of them.
So here they are!

- Procedural Generation
- Items
- Characters
- Enemies
- Crafting
- Building
That's it.
Sounds way better than Minecraft, doesn't it?
Well you're WRONG.
It's way worse than Minecraft!
In fact, it's not even a game right now!
It's not even code!
It's just a GitHub repository right now.
